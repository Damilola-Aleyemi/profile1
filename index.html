          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p><br>
            Paul Amusan is a young, energetic, and talented fashion designer who
            focuses on his men’s clothing line, Paul Amusan. His work draws
            inspiration from local Nigerian fabrics coupled with Japanese
            tailoring designs. His designs are masculine, yet modern and trendy
            by way of transforming an ordinary look into a sophisticated design
            that embraces elegance. <br /><br/>I began acquired his love for fashion
            when he was a young boy where he spent his time sketching and
            drawing. He loves to work with colors, and his awesome talent has
            seen his pieces worn by famous politicians and celebrities. Young
            and successful, he is a talented fashion designer to watch out for
            as his name continues to cause ripples in both the local and global
            fashion industries. <br /></br/>
            While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique where
            president of the company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my potential and
            passion for unique fashion and helped me launch my first fashion
            collection. My passion for African fashion is profound. “Everything
            begins for me with the print and fabric, which usually has some
            shine,” exclaims Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well as
            extensive global experience with having lived and worked in New York
            and Milan have been instrumental in her success and international
            spotlight. <br /> <br/>
            My pieces are also sold globally in the UK, US, and France. Anthony
            uses his talent to make an impact on the community through a
            mentoring program he runs that helps young and upcoming Nigerian
            designers excel and compete on a global platform. Nature, colors,
            and artwork are his main sources of inspiration.
